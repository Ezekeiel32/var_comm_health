      "body": "Hello,\n\nIt's been a busy month with new features and quality-of-life improvements to Cursor!\n\nPlan Mode\nPlan Mode does deep research into your codebase, reading files and asking clarifying questions to create a detailed plan before writing any code. You can review and refine the plan before handing it to Cursor to execute.\n\nWe've found that this allows agents to run for significantly longer.\n\n\nSlash Commands\nYou can now create reusable prompts and quickly share them with your team. Commands are stored in .cursor/commands/[command].md. Run them by typing /  in the Agent input and selecting the command from the dropdown menu.\n\nWe've been using them for running linters, fixing compile errors, and creating PRs with detailed descriptions and conventional commits.\n\n\nBrowser Controls\nAgent can control a web browser to test applications, audit accessibility, convert designs into code, and more. With full access to console logs and network traffic, Agent can debug issues and automate comprehensive testing workflows.\n\nStart using with @Browser.\n\n\nPR Summaries from Bugbot\nWhen creating a PR in GitHub, Bugbot will now generate a summary of the changes. The summary will be updated as you push changes so it's always up-to-date.\n\n\nLet us know any feedback you have!\n\n- Cursor Team",
